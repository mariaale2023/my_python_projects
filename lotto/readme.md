## welcome to lotto picker
if you are like me, you may consider the random numbers in lotto NZ may not be random enough. That's why I am using Python to pick the numbers for me

### instructions
open main.py
enter how many lines you want to play and Python will pick randomly for you

### notes
There is no data validation. so enter an int number, or it will crash.
